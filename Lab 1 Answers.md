Discuss the differences among the results. Does the starting point make a difference?
	The iterators create different outputs for each starting point so starting points do matter.
	
	The random iterator's output is different each time and will go back to the same state multiple times

	Breadth and Closest have the same outputs while depth is the opposite

Give two or three examples of how/why a real-world map might require more than four colors.
	The first one is if a state/country does not have continuous borders. 

	If there are is a corner that is shared among 4 different states such as the UT, CO, AZ, and NM 4 corners border. You will need a color for each of those plus any other touching the select state.
